# queueing-models
This repository contains the simulation of the M/M/1 queueing model, implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. The project includes visualizations for queue metrics using both JFreeChart in Java and Matplotlib in Python. Future models like M/M/K, G/G/1, and G/G/K are currently under development.
